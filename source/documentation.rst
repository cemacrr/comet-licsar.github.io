Documentation
=============

So it seems we can update documentation just by editing the rst files in the 'source' folder

links are automatically converted, e.g. as:

  https://gitlab.com/comet_licsar/licsar_documentation/-/wikis/home.


this is section

`this is quoted text`

ok, now this is from RSTPAD:

h5

h6
""

**bold**
*italic*
- list
#. numlist
something

s ---- thing

  tab
`link <http://example.com/>`_
.. image:: image
inline ``code is ``this

code block ::

  is
  this block
  is this

highlighted

.. code:: python3

  block
  of
  code
  is
  this

tralala

The library can also be installed using ``pip``::

  pip install sphinx

The rst format was developed for writing documentation. There are numerous markup options available such as using asterisks to emphasise text::

  *emphasised text*

will be rendered as:

*emphasised text*

code example:

.. code:: python

  def function_a(arg_a, arg_b):
      """
      This is function a, which adds two values 
  
      :param arg_a: first argument is a ``float``
      :param arg_b: second argument in an ``int``
      :return: arg_a + arg_b
  
      Example usage::
  
        >>> from python_library import function_a
        >>> function_a(2, 3)
        5
      """
      return arg_a + arg_b

This will produce documentation which renders as:

.. py:function:: python_library.function_a(arg_a, arg_b)
  :noindex:

  This is function a, which adds two values

  :param arg_a: first argument is a ``float``
  :param arg_b: second argument in an ``int``
  :return: arg_a + arg_b

  Example usage::

    >>> from python_library import function_a
    >>> function_a(2, 3)
    5

To include autogenerated documentation, there are various methods available (see the `Sphinx Autodoc Documentation`_), for example, to include documentation for all members of the Python library ``python_library``::

  .. automodule:: python_library
      :members:

this::

  $ make 
  Sphinx v4.4.0
  Please use `make target' where target is one of
    html        to make standalone HTML files
    dirhtml     to make HTML files named index.html in directories
    singlehtml  to make a single large HTML file
  ...

For example, to build HTML documentation, run::

  make html
